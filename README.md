# restaurant-review-project

This is a project which is a part of an interviewing process for an internship position as a front-end developer.

For this project I will implement JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This project will display restaurants using the Yelp API. Once the user select a category of restaurants he will be shown all of the restaurants' information that cooincide with that category. The information diplayed will be: the restaurant's name, restaurant's image, review, and pricing field, with an option of viewing the restaurant's webpage.

In this project I will: + Use Yelp API to obtain information for restaurants
                        + Make sure that the web page is responsive for desktops, tablets, and phones

# Desktop version
In the desktop version the user will be presented with three buttons for different categories of restaurants. Once the user clicks on a particular category of restaurants below of these buttons, 15 restaurants that match the category will be shown. 
The restraunts will be shown as "cards" with each card containing restaurant's name, image, review, pricing and a button which leads to the restaurant's website.

Page containing this the information about different restaurants will be infinite scrolling.
Once the user scrolls down to the last three cards, the next 15 restaurants will be presented.

An animated three dots icon will be shown as the user scrolls down, indicating that more restaurants are being loaded.

# Mobile version
In the mobile version the user will be presented with two buttons for different categories of restaurants. Again, once the user clicks on a particular category of restaurants, he will be presented with restaurants that match the category. 
The restraunts will be shown as "cards" with each card containing restaurant's name, image, review, pricing and a button which leads to the restaurant's website.

This page won't be infinite scrolling.
Once the user scrolls down to the 9th restaurant, next 15 restaurants will be loaded.
